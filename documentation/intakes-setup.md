## What the feature does

When `intakes.enabled: true` is set in a business YAML, Riley is given two
new function tools — `record_intake_answer` and `finalize_intake` — plus an
INTAKES section in the system prompt listing the configured case types and
their question scripts.

A typical call looks like this:

1. Caller says they're a new client and would like to do an intake by phone.
2. Riley speaks the configured `preamble_en` (or `preamble_es` for Spanish
   callers) — a short heads-up about call length so the caller can opt in.
3. Riley confirms which case type applies, then walks through the case type's
   questions one at a time.
4. After every answer, Riley calls `record_intake_answer` with the
   `case_type`, `question_key`, `spoken_text` (verbatim, in the caller's
   language), `language`, and an inline `english_summary`. The partial intake
   is persisted to disk and queued for a structured call-end email after each
   call.
5. For questions marked `critical: true`, Riley verifies the answer before
   moving on. Phone numbers, Social Security numbers, and email addresses get
   digit-by-digit or character-by-character readback; names, dates, and other
   critical fields are repeated naturally.
6. When all required questions are answered, Riley calls `finalize_intake`
   with the confirmed legal name, callback number, and a 1–3 sentence
   English overview. The final JSON file is written and the intake email is
   queued for call-end.
7. If `info_packets.enabled: true`, Riley asks whether the caller wants the
   configured packet emailed. Sending is a two-step round-trip: after the
   caller gives permission and spells the address, Riley calls
   `send_info_packet` with the spelled address and `consent_confirmed=true`.
   The tool does not send yet — it returns the parsed address, which Riley
   reads back to the caller letter by letter. Only after the caller
   explicitly confirms does Riley call `send_info_packet` again with the
   same address and `destination_confirmed=true`, which performs the send.

## Configuration overview

A minimal `intakes:` block looks like this:

```yaml
intakes:
  enabled: true
  preamble_en: |
    This intake usually takes 15–20 minutes. Do you have time to go through
    it now, or should I take a short message and we can complete it later?
  preamble_es: |
    Esta entrevista generalmente toma 15–20 minutos. ¿Tiene tiempo ahora,
    o prefiere dejar un mensaje breve?
  submission:
    file_path: "./messages/<slug>/intakes/"
  case_types:
    - key: workers_comp
      display_name: "Workers' Compensation"
      display_name_es: "Compensación por accidentes laborales"
      questions:
        - key: caller_full_name
          prompt_en: "Could you start with your full legal name?"
          prompt_es: "¿Podría comenzar con su nombre legal completo?"
          required: true
          critical: true
          validation: text
        - key: employer
          prompt_en: "Who was your employer at the time of the accident?"
          prompt_es: "¿Quién era su empleador al momento del accidente?"
          required: true
          critical: false
          validation: text
```

Top-level fields:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `enabled` | bool | No (default `false`) | Master switch. When `false`, the tools are unavailable and the INTAKES prompt section is omitted. |
| `preamble_en` | string | No | Heads-up disclosure Riley speaks before starting questions. Empty string disables the preamble. |
| `preamble_es` | string | No | Spanish version. If omitted, Riley translates `preamble_en` at call time (less reliable than a pre-translated string). |
| `submission` | object | Yes | Where partial + final intake JSONs are written. |
| `submission.file_path` | string | Yes | Directory for the JSON files. Must end with `/`. Recommend a sub-directory like `messages/<slug>/intakes/` so it's easy to find. |
| `case_types` | list | Yes | At least one case type required. |

---

## Question schema

Each `case_types[*]` entry has:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `key` | string | Yes | Canonical identifier passed to `record_intake_answer(case_type=...)`. Stable across question rewording. |
| `display_name` | string | Yes | Human-readable label shown in the email subject and in Riley's English speech. |
| `display_name_es` | string | No | Spanish display name. Used in Spanish-language calls. |
| `google_form_id` | string | No | Used by the sync CLI only. Not consulted at call time. |
| `questions` | list | Yes (≥1) | Question script. |

Each `questions[*]` entry has:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `key` | string | Yes | Canonical field name (e.g. `employer`, `accident_date`). Unique within a case type. Stable across reword changes. |
| `prompt_en` | string | Yes | The English question Riley reads verbatim. |
| `prompt_es` | string | No | Spanish translation. Strongly recommended for any business that takes Spanish calls. |
| `required` | bool | No (default `true`) | If `false`, Riley may skip the question if the caller declines. Required questions must be present in the final submission. |
| `validation` | `text`/`phone`/`email`/`date`/`yes_no` | No (default `text`) | Advisory shape. Influences the phrasing of the prompt but does not strictly enforce the answer's format. |
| `critical` | bool | No (default `false`) | If `true`, Riley verifies the answer and waits for explicit "yes" before moving on. Use per-character readback only for phone numbers, SSNs, and email addresses; repeat names/dates naturally. |

## Keypad (DTMF) entry

For fields that are entirely numeric — phone numbers, Social Security numbers —
the Realtime model can mis-hear digits when the caller speaks them aloud. Mark
those questions with `input: dtmf` to have the caller enter the digits on their
phone keypad instead. The model handles non-numeric fields (names, dates, email
addresses) via voice as normal; only set `input: dtmf` where every valid answer
is a pure digit string.

### Configuring a keypad question

```yaml
questions:
  - key: callback_phone
    prompt_en: "What is your callback phone number?"
    required: true
    critical: true
    validation: phone
    input: dtmf          # caller types on keypad; model does NOT ask them to say it
    dtmf_length: 10      # auto-completes after 10 digits (US 10-digit number)

  - key: ssn_last4
    prompt_en: "What are the last four digits of your Social Security number?"
    required: true
    critical: true
    validation: text
    input: dtmf          # no dtmf_length: caller presses # to submit
```

| Field | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| `input: dtmf` | Question uses keypad entry. The model calls `await_keypad_entry` instead of asking the caller to say the number. |
| `dtmf_length: N` | Capture auto-completes after N digits — caller does not need to press `#`. Use `10` for a US 10-digit number, `9` for a full SSN. Omit (or set `null`) when the digit count varies. |

### Caller flow

1. The model reaches a `dtmf` question and calls `await_keypad_entry(question_key=...)`.
2. The model tells the caller: "Please type your number on your keypad and press pound."
3. The caller presses digits. `*` clears the buffer and lets them start over.
4. When the caller presses `#` (or the digit count reaches `dtmf_length`), the
   tool returns the exact digits to the model.
5. The model reads the digits back one by one: "I have 7-1-3-5-5-5-0-1-3-8. Is that correct?"
6. After the caller confirms, the model calls `record_intake_answer` with the
   confirmed digit string.

If no input arrives within 30 seconds, the tool returns a voice-fallback
instruction and the model asks the caller to say the number aloud instead,
using the normal digit-by-digit readback for `critical` fields.

### DTMF auto-enablement

The `sip_dtmf_received` listener wires automatically when **any** question has
`input: dtmf`, even if the business has no `dtmf:` menu block configured. There
is nothing else to enable — add `input: dtmf` to a question and keypad capture
works for that question. The menu handler and capture buffer share one event
listener; capture takes precedence while `await_keypad_entry` is active.

### Fields that should stay `voice`

Email addresses, names, and free-text fields contain non-digit characters that
cannot be entered on a standard phone keypad. Leave those at `input: voice` (the
default). A DTMF question whose answer turns out to contain letters will not be
capturable — the caller will be pushed to the voice-fallback path.

---

## Spanish-language calls

When a caller starts speaking Spanish, Riley conducts the intake in Spanish
using each question's `prompt_es`. For each answer, `record_intake_answer`
is called with:

- `spoken_text` — the answer verbatim in Spanish.
- `language` — `"es"`.
- `english_summary` — Riley's concise English rendering of the same answer.

The intake email shows both — the original Spanish answer plus the English
summary — so a Spanish-speaking caller still produces a record that an
English-only intake-team member can scan.

For Spanish-speaking businesses that haven't pre-translated their questions,
omit `prompt_es` and Riley will translate `prompt_en` at call time. This is
less reliable than a pre-translated string but works as a fallback.

---

## Output: structured JSON + email

When `finalize_intake` is called, two artifacts are produced.

**1. Structured JSON file** under `submission.file_path`:

```
messages/<slug>/intakes/
├── intake_20260519_184530_room-abc.final.json
```

File contents:

```json
{
  "case_type": "workers_comp",
  "business_name": "Acme Law",
  "call_id": "room-abc",
  "caller_name": "Jane Doe",
  "callback_number": "+15551112222",
  "language": "en",
  "english_overview": "New WC intake, injured on the job at Acme Construction.",
  "status": "final",
  "started_at": "2026-05-19T18:42:11+00:00",
  "completed_at": "2026-05-19T18:55:48+00:00",
  "answers": [
    {
      "question_key": "caller_full_name",
      "prompt": "Could you start with your full legal name?",
      "spoken_text": "Jane Doe",
      "language": "en",
      "english_summary": "Jane Doe",
      "captured_at": "2026-05-19T18:43:02+00:00"
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

**2. Email** at call-end via whichever EmailChannel(s) are configured in
`messages.channels`. Subject: `"Intake: <case type display> — <caller name>
[<business name>]"`. Body contains a per-question table (Question / Caller
answer / English summary), the English overview, and the full transcript
embedded at the bottom.

---

## Partial intakes (mid-call disconnects)

After every `record_intake_answer` call, a partial JSON file is written:

```
messages/<slug>/intakes/intake_room-abc.partial.json
```

If the caller hangs up before `finalize_intake` runs, the partial file is
the durable record. It has `status: "partial"`, no `completed_at`, and only
the answers captured so far. A partial intake email is also sent at call-end
with the captured question/answer list above the transcript.

When `finalize_intake` runs successfully, the partial file is removed and
the final JSON is written under a different name. The two files never
coexist.

---

## Mid-intake escape hatch

If the caller says mid-intake that they want to be called back, want to
speak to a person, or simply don't have time to finish, Riley is instructed
in the INTAKES prompt section to:

1. Stop calling `record_intake_answer`.
2. Call `take_message` immediately with at least the caller's name and
   callback number.
3. Note in the message that the intake was started but not completed.

The partial JSON file already on disk gives the receiving team whatever was
captured before the caller bailed.

---

## Optional info packet after intake

`info_packets:` can be enabled alongside `intakes:` to send callers a
pre-approved email after the intake. This is separate from the internal intake
email sent to staff. The packet email goes directly to the caller-provided
destination.

Important constraints:

- Riley must ask permission before sending a packet.
- The destination is confirmed in a tool-enforced round-trip: Riley asks the
  caller to spell the email address and passes it to `send_info_packet`;
  the tool returns the parsed address without sending; Riley reads it back
  letter by letter; only an explicit "yes" plus a second call with
  `destination_confirmed=true` and the same address triggers the send.
- V1 is email-only. SMS and attachments are not supported.
- Packet subject, body, and links are configured in YAML. Riley must not
  generate marketing copy or summarize packet content herself.
- Packet send success/failure appears in call metadata and in the call-end
  summary email.

Minimal packet config:

```yaml
email:
  from: "AI Receptionist <noreply@example.com>"
  sender:
    type: "smtp"
    smtp:
      host: "smtp.example.com"
      port: 587
      username: "user"
      password: ${SMTP_PASSWORD}
      use_tls: true

info_packets:
  enabled: true
  default_packet: intake_overview
  packets:
    - key: intake_overview
      display_name: "Intake Overview"
      email_subject: "Information from Example Law"
      email_body: |
        Thank you for completing an intake.

        Our office will review your information and follow up during business hours.
      links:
        - label: "Website"
          url: "https://example.com"
```

For intake-line deployments that should not behave as a general receptionist,
set `agent.mode: intake_only`. That prompt mode suppresses routing, FAQ, and
business-hours behavior and keeps Riley focused on completing intake or taking
a callback message.

## Tool reference

### `record_intake_answer(case_type, question_key, spoken_text, language, english_summary)`

Called after every answered question. Validates that `case_type` and
`question_key` exist in the configured intakes block. Persists the partial
JSON after every call.

Returns a short confirmation string the LLM uses as its tool reply
("Answer recorded for `<key>`. Proceed to the next question.").

### `finalize_intake(caller_name, callback_number, english_overview)`

Called exactly once at the end of the intake, after every required question
has been answered. Writes the final JSON, removes the partial, queues the
email for call-end, and records the `intake_submitted` lifecycle outcome.

Returns a short confirmation the LLM uses to wrap up the call.

When `info_packets.enabled: true`, the return message tells Riley to offer the
configured packet next. Riley still must ask permission and confirm the email
address before calling `send_info_packet`.

### `send_info_packet(packet_key, channel, destination, consent_confirmed, destination_confirmed)`

Called only after the caller consents. `channel` must be `"email"` in v1 and
`consent_confirmed` must be `true`. The first call with a destination does
NOT send — it returns the parsed address for Riley to read back letter by
letter. The send happens only on a second call with the same address
(case-insensitive) and `destination_confirmed=true`. Unknown packet keys,
invalid email addresses, unsupported channels, and email transport failures
return safe corrective messages rather than internal error details.

---

## Operational tips

- **Critical-field readback**: mark expensive-to-fix fields with
  `critical: true`. Riley reads phone numbers, SSNs, and email addresses back
  digit-by-digit or character-by-character, but repeats names, dates, and
  other critical fields naturally. Non-critical answers are not read back.
- **Disclose call length upfront**: the `preamble_en` exists so the caller
  can decline a long intake and just leave a message. Don't skip this — a
  surprised caller who hangs up halfway through is worse than a caller who
  knows what they're getting into.
- **One submission per call**: only one intake per call is supported.
  Re-calling `finalize_intake` replaces the prior submission; the final
  email goes out exactly once at call-end.
- **No email channel, no email**: if you enable intakes but have no email
  channel configured in `messages.channels`, the structured JSON file is
  the only artifact. That's a supported deployment (file-only) but make
  sure your intake team knows to watch the directory.
- **Stable keys**: once you set a `case_type.key` or a `question.key`, keep
  it stable across question-wording changes. Downstream consumers (the
  intake team's filtering, future CMS sync, ad-hoc grep) all rely on the
  keys, not the prompts.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-09-16

First tagged release since 0.1.0. Everything below shipped to production incrementally between 2026-03 and 2026-09; see `git log` for per-change commits.

### Changed
- `handle_call` setup stages (`handle_call_entered` … `setup_complete`) are now
  emitted through the normal `receptionist` logger as
  `handle_call stage=<name>` INFO lines. The previous per-PID breadcrumb file
  tracer (stderr `print` + synchronous file writes on the event loop, 8x per
  call) was removed; the `breadcrumbs/` directories it created are no longer
  written.
- Configuration reference model table again lists every Realtime model that
  is live (`gpt-realtime-2.1`, `-2.1-mini`, `-2`, `gpt-realtime`), marks
  `gpt-realtime-mini` as deprecated by OpenAI, and notes that `gpt-live-1`
  is not a drop-in `voice.model`.
- Minimum `livekit-agents` / `livekit-plugins-openai` raised to 1.8.2
  (verified: no API changes on the surface this project uses; pulls in the
  1.6.5–1.7.1 Realtime orphaned-response/reconnect fixes and the 1.8.2
  prefork preload).

### Deprecated
- `voice.auth.type: oauth_codex` now logs a WARNING when a business YAML is
  loaded with it, stating that the path no longer authenticates the GA
  Realtime API and calls will connect to dead air. Loading still succeeds so
  old configs parse; switch to `api_key`.

### Fixed
- `voice.max_response_output_tokens` was dropped silently when the installed
  `livekit-plugins-openai` had no `update_options(max_response_output_tokens=)`
  setter. It now logs a WARNING naming the cap that was not applied.
- The default Realtime model and active configuration examples now use
  `gpt-realtime-2.1`. `gpt-realtime-2.1-mini` is documented as an explicit
  lower-cost option that should be validated on the caller workload before use.
- Agent-initiated call endings (goodbye / silence / max-duration / unproductive
  turns) now drop the SIP caller BEFORE running the call-end fan-out
  (transcript + email, including the AI summary). Previously the email work —
  up to ~20 s with summary generation — ran before the hangup, so the caller
  heard the goodbye then sat on a live line for several seconds. Email delivery
  remains reliable (the agent's job process survives the SIP BYE; on_call_ended
  is idempotent).
- send_info_packet now enforces a two-step destination confirmation: the
  first call returns the parsed address for letter-by-letter read-back;
  sending requires a second call with destination_confirmed=true and a
  matching address.
- When `email.triggers.on_call_end` is enabled, each call now produces exactly
  ONE staff email: the call-end email absorbs message, intake, and booking
  content (plus the optional AI Summary section), and the separate per-trigger
  emails are suppressed. When `on_call_end` is disabled, the separate message,
  intake, and booking emails still fire exactly as before.
- Call transcripts are now attached to notification emails as `.txt` files
  (`transcript_<call_id>.txt`) instead of being embedded inline between
  `--- Transcript ---` markers. The email body shows the attachment filename
  and the on-disk transcript path; an unreadable transcript file logs a
  warning and the email still sends without the attachment. Applies to
  message, call-end, booking, and intake emails when the channel's
  `include_transcript` is true.
- AI summary generation is wall-clock capped by `email.summary.timeout_seconds`
  (default 20 s): if the OpenAI chat-completion call exceeds this deadline or
  fails for any reason, the Summary section is omitted and the email still sends.
- The AI summary is skipped entirely for calls with no transcript and no
  captured content (no message, intake, or booking) — e.g. an instant hangup —
  instead of spending an LLM call on an empty call.

### Added
- Keypad (DTMF) entry for digit-only intake questions via `IntakeQuestion.input: dtmf` (+ optional `dtmf_length`).
- `voice.reasoning_effort` and `voice.max_response_output_tokens` config fields.
  `reasoning_effort` (`minimal`/`low`/`medium`/`high`) configures reasoning-capable
  Realtime models such as `gpt-realtime-2.1`; lower effort can reduce latency
  and output-token usage. `max_response_output_tokens` caps tokens per response
  to protect against exhausting the account's per-minute token rate limit. Both require
  `livekit-plugins-openai` >= 1.6 and are ignored gracefully on older builds.
- Realtime error safety net: on a recoverable Realtime API error (most commonly
  `rate_limit_exceeded`), the agent now speaks a brief filler and re-triggers
  the model response instead of leaving the caller in silence. Bursts of errors
  collapse to a single filler + retry, and recoveries are capped per call (3)
  so a sustained failure can't loop indefinitely. The filler is not added to
  the conversation context.
- AI-generated call summary in call-end emails (`email.summary` config block, default model gpt-5-mini).
- **DTMF auto-attendant (issue #16).** Configure `dtmf.digits` to map keypad
  presses to actions: transfer to a routing entry, take a message, end the
  call, or repeat the menu. Presses are handled deterministically off LiveKit's
  `sip_dtmf_received` event, not through the LLM. Transfers reuse the same SIP
  transfer path as the voice `transfer_call` tool, so the `intake_only` gate
  applies to both. Same-digit repeats are debounced and in-flight presses are
  suppressed. Each press is recorded in call metadata with a per-event status,
  and the call-end summary email renders a "Keypad actions" section. An
  optional `dtmf.menu_announcement_en` is spoken once after the greeting.
- **Structured new-client intake by phone.** New `intakes` config block lets
  Riley walk a caller through a configurable question script per case type
  and email a structured submission at call-end. Two new function tools —
  `record_intake_answer` (called once per question) and `finalize_intake`
  (called once at the end) — drive the flow. Partial answers are persisted
  to disk after every question so a mid-call disconnect still leaves the
  receiving team with what was captured. Spanish callers are supported: each
  answer stores both the verbatim spoken text and an English summary, and
  the intake email shows both. See
  [`documentation/intakes-setup.md`](intakes-setup.md) for the full guide.
- New `intake_submitted` outcome on `CallMetadata.outcomes` and a matching
  human label in the call-end email subject when an intake completes.
- Opt-in `agent.mode: intake_only` prompt behavior for intake-only phone
  lines. This mode suppresses receptionist routing, FAQ, and hours sections
  while keeping intake, callback-message, and call-ending guidance.
- Consent-gated email information packets. New `info_packets` YAML config and
  `send_info_packet` tool let Riley send pre-approved text/links to a
  caller-confirmed email address after permission. V1 is email-only and does
  not support SMS, attachments, PDFs, or model-generated packet copy.

### Security
- Hardened webhook configuration and notification transports: webhook URLs
  now reject localhost, loopback, private, and link-local hosts; webhook and
  Resend errors avoid logging sensitive URL/body details; and the pre-commit
  secret scan now checks generic assignments and YAML raw-secret fields.
- Tightened config validation so invalid timezones, unknown config keys,
  unsafe env-var placeholders, and excessive calendar booking windows fail at
  config load instead of during a live call.

### Fixed
- **Info packet never sent on the confirming call (consent gate trap).** The
  two-step `send_info_packet` flow checked `consent_confirmed` before the
  destination-confirmation logic, so the second (confirming) call — which the
  model makes with only `destination_confirmed=true`, exactly as the read-back
  instruction directs — was refused by the consent gate and no packet was ever
  sent (the agent then falsely told the caller it had been). The gate now treats
  a confirming call against the already-consented pending address as carrying
  consent forward; consent is still required on the first call and cannot be
  bypassed (a `destination_confirmed=true` with no prior consented read-back
  still refuses).
- **Realtime Beta API sunset (production outage).** OpenAI disabled the
  Realtime *Beta* API on 2026-06-03; the GA endpoint no longer accepts
  ChatGPT/Codex OAuth tokens, so deployments using `voice.auth.type:
  oauth_codex` began failing every call with a `500` WebSocket handshake error
  and the caller hearing dead air. Resolved by switching affected tenants to
  `voice.auth.type: api_key` (a standard `sk-` key) and the GA model
  `gpt-realtime`. Added a troubleshooting entry ("Realtime handshake fails with
  `500` / Beta API sunset") documenting the symptom, root cause, and fix.
- Made call finalization more resilient: recording/transcript failures no
  longer prevent deferred message emails from firing, deferred message queues
  are cleared after dispatch, and background tasks are retained until they
  complete.
- Added regression coverage for SIP transfer behavior, lifecycle failure
  paths, webhook retry semantics, Resend error hygiene, config validation,
  and email subject normalization.

### Changed
- Default `voice.model` is now `gpt-realtime` (the GA Realtime model), changed
  from `gpt-realtime-1.5` which was tied to the now-retired Realtime Beta path.
  Example configs, the configuration reference model table, and test fixtures
  were updated accordingly. `gpt-realtime-1.5` remains a valid string but is no
  longer the recommended default.
- Updated public documentation and examples to reflect the current
  `messages.channels` schema, implemented webhook delivery, stricter webhook
  URL validation, current test layout, and optional voice idle/auth blocks.
- Refined phone-intake prompt guidance so only contact identifiers such as
  phone numbers, Social Security numbers, and email addresses use
  digit-by-digit or character-by-character readback; non-critical intake
  answers are not read back.
- Queued structured partial-intake emails after every recorded answer so an
  interrupted intake still arrives as a readable question/answer list above
  the transcript. The live agent also refreshes its Realtime tool registry
  after startup to prevent intake tools from being advertised in the prompt
  but missing at execution time.
- Call-end emails now include any `take_message` content in a structured
  Captured Content section above recording/transcript details, so the call
  summary remains actionable even when the separate message email is missed.
- Call-end emails now include info-packet send records with packet name,
  channel, destination, and sent/failed status.
- `agent.mode: intake_only` now blocks `transfer_call` at runtime, so transfer
  attempts become message/callback handling instead of SIP transfers.
- The Windows restart launcher now kills orphaned `python -m receptionist.agent
  dev` workers from the same checkout before spawning the new worker, writes a
  generation token for the spawned process, and preserves `.env.local` priority
  over `.env` while respecting real caller environment variables.
- Local worker status checks are now generation-aware: `agent-status.ps1`
  requires the pidfile PID to be this checkout's `receptionist.agent dev`,
  requires a registration after the current restart marker, and fails if it
  sees unexpected same-checkout orphan workers.
- The worker now performs a best-effort signaling warmup in each job-runner
  subprocess at startup (a read-only LiveKit API call that warms DNS/TLS to
  the LiveKit host), reducing first-call cold-start latency that could cause
  the first call after idle to ring without pickup. The warmup never blocks
  startup and logs under `component=agent.warmup`. See the cold-start entry in
  [`documentation/troubleshooting.md`](troubleshooting.md).

### Fixed
- **Agent-initiated `end_call` no longer drops the call-end and deferred
  message emails.** When the **caller** hung up first, `on_call_ended`
  ran fine; when the **agent** ended the call (via the `end_call` tool —
  caller goodbye, silence timeout, max duration, unproductive turns),
  the LiveKit job process started tearing down asyncio's default
  ThreadPoolExecutor before our `on_call_ended` could finish, and
  `aiosmtplib`'s DNS lookup failed with `Executor shutdown has been
  called`. Result: zero emails delivered on agent-ended calls.
  - `_speak_goodbye_and_terminate` now `await`s
    `lifecycle.on_call_ended()` **before** waiting for goodbye playout or
    invoking `_terminate_room`, so transcript writes + deferred message
    emails + call-end emails fire while the event loop and executor are
    still healthy even if the caller hangs up during the goodbye.
  - `CallLifecycle` gains a `_finalized` flag. The LiveKit session-close
    handler still invokes `on_call_ended` on natural disconnect, but
    the second call is now a guarded no-op (no duplicate emails, no
    duplicate transcript writes).
  - INFO-level diagnostic logging on both sides
    (`agent_end: invoking lifecycle.on_call_ended pre-terminate
    (pending=N, channels=M)`, `on_call_ended entered (finalized=…)`)
    so the same race is one log read away if it ever recurs.
  - Regression test in `tests/test_lifecycle.py::test_on_call_ended_is_idempotent`
    proves a double-call yields exactly one email and one transcript write.
  - Regression test in `tests/test_end_call.py::test_speak_goodbye_finalizes_before_waiting_for_playout`
    proves call finalization starts before waiting on the goodbye playout.

### Changed (privacy / housekeeping)
- **Sanitized the tracked law-firm template.** The previous
  `config/businesses/example-licomplaw.yaml` carried client-identifying
  values (business display name, receptionist persona name, intake email
  domain, and a tenant-specific Resend env-var name). Renamed to
  `config/businesses/example-workers-comp.yaml` and replaced every
  identifying string with a generic placeholder:
  - business display name → `Example Workers' Comp Law`
  - persona name → `Alex`
  - intake email → `intake@example.com`
  - Resend env var → `EXAMPLE_RESEND_API_KEY`
  - file/recording/transcript paths → `./{messages,recordings,transcripts}/example-workers-comp/`

  Updated `tests/test_config.py` to match (with a regression guard that
  asserts the public template contains no `licomplaw` / `nycomplaw`
  substring), and updated `.env.example`, `documentation/ringcentral-setup.md`,
  `documentation/multi-business-setup.md`, `documentation/configuration-reference.md`,
  and `tests/MANUAL.md` to reference the new template name and `<slug>`
  placeholders instead of tenant-specific values. Operators copying the
  template into a tenant-local YAML still override every placeholder, so
  no behavior changes — only the surface that ends up on GitHub.
- **Stopped tracking `/docs/`.** That directory holds internal design
  specs, implementation plans, and superpowers workflow artifacts that
  aren't user-facing reference docs. Added `docs/` to `.gitignore` and
  ran `git rm -r --cached docs/` so the files stay on disk locally for
  development history but no longer ship in the public repository. The
  three tracked references to `docs/plans/` (in `CLAUDE.md`,
  `documentation/CHANGELOG.md`'s artifact list, and `documentation/index.md`'s
  file-tree) were removed.

### Added
- **Telephony setup guide for non-default paths** (closes #4).
  New `documentation/telephony-setup.md` documents the three realistic
  ways a PSTN number reaches AIReceptionist: porting to a SIP trunk
  provider (Path A — the tested default), Bring Your Own Carrier with a
  transit provider like Telnyx BYOC (Path B), and keeping a copper
  landline via an FXS gateway (Grandstream HT813 or similar) plus an
  on-prem PBX (Path C). Includes a starter Asterisk `pjsip.conf` +
  `extensions.conf` snippet for Path C, a trade-off table comparing the
  three, and explicit E911 / power-outage / internet-outage caveats.
  Linked from README and `documentation/index.md`. Path C is explicitly
  marked as untested by the project's CI; treat the snippet as a
  starting point.

### Changed
- **Configuration reference rewritten for the channels-based schema.**
  `documentation/configuration-reference.md` previously described the
  long-gone `messages.delivery: file|webhook` shape. It now documents the
  current `messages.channels: [...]` list (with the file, email, and
  webhook channel sub-schemas), the top-level `email:` block (SMTP /
  Resend, triggers), the `recording:` block (local + S3-compatible
  storage, consent preamble), the `transcripts:` block, the `retention:`
  block, and the `languages:` block. Complete Example, Table of Contents,
  and Validation Rules updated to match.
- **Linux systemd deployment guide tightened for issue #14.** The previous
  recipe referenced `/opt/ai-receptionist` while `git clone` actually
  produces `/opt/AIReceptionist`, and didn't show the
  `python -m venv .venv` step. The agent appeared to start but couldn't
  import its own modules under the service user (`ModuleNotFoundError`).
  Updated the deployment guide to use `/opt/AIReceptionist` consistently,
  to create the service user explicitly, to set up the venv with
  `python3 -m venv .venv` before `pip install -e .`, to lock `.env` to
  `chmod 600` and `chown ai-receptionist`, and to document the
  lowercased-alias symlink as the optional last step instead of an
  implicit assumption.

### Added
- **Full transcript embedded in caller-message emails too** (parallel to
  the call-end email). When the caller invokes `take_message` mid-call,
  the file/webhook channels still fire synchronously (caller hears
  "saved", message data is durable on disk before we return), but the
  EmailChannel portion is intentionally deferred to call-end so the
  message email can embed the full conversation that led up to the
  message. New plumbing:
  - `Dispatcher.dispatch_message` accepts `skip_email_channel=True`,
    which the `take_message` tool now sets.
  - `CallLifecycle.enqueue_message_email(msg)` queues messages; the
    queue drains in `on_call_ended` after the transcript file is written,
    firing `EmailChannel.deliver(msg, ctx)` for each configured channel
    when the `on_message` email trigger is enabled.
  - `build_message_email` mirrors `build_call_end_email`: it accepts
    `include_transcript` / `include_recording_link` and embeds the
    transcript with the same `(transcript_unavailable)` fallback when
    the file can't be read. `EmailChannel.deliver` passes the per-channel
    flags through from `channel_config`.
  - 8 new regression tests across templates, channel, dispatcher, and
    lifecycle; full suite `400 passed, 2 skipped`.
- **Full transcript embedded in call-end emails** (and `include_transcript` /
  `include_recording_link` per-channel toggles now actually do something).
  Previously the two flags on `messages.channels[type=email]` were dead — the
  call-end template only ever rendered the transcript file *path*. Now, when
  `include_transcript: true` (default) and a markdown transcript exists, the
  agent reads the file and embeds the conversation directly into the email
  body (plain text + a monospace `<pre>` block in HTML), so the operator can
  read the call without opening another file. If the markdown file is missing
  or unreadable the email still sends with the path plus a
  `(transcript_unavailable)` marker — the call-end flow never crashes over
  an unreadable transcript. `include_recording_link: false` now suppresses
  the recording URL/failure row entirely for tenants who don't want bucket
  links in mail. New regression coverage in `tests/email/test_templates.py`
  and `tests/messaging/test_email_channel.py`; full suite `390 passed, 2 skipped`.
- **RingCentral + Twilio law-firm deployment guide**:
  `documentation/ringcentral-setup.md` documents the RingEX reception-group
  path where a Twilio DID acts as the AI bridge into LiveKit SIP, using named
  agent dispatch with `metadata={"config":"<slug>"}` where `<slug>` is the
  tenant's chosen business slug.
- **`example-workers-comp` business config template**: tracked template for
  a workers' compensation law firm using the RingCentral + Twilio + LiveKit
  path. Uses generic placeholder values (business name
  `Example Workers' Comp Law`, persona `Alex`, intake email
  `intake@example.com`, Resend env var `EXAMPLE_RESEND_API_KEY`) so the
  public template never carries client identity; operators override every
  placeholder when they copy the template into their gitignored local YAML.
  Enables local recording + transcript storage, disables the recording
  consent preamble, and ships 15 placeholder claims-rep transfer targets
  to replace before go-live. Originally tracked as `example-licomplaw.yaml`
  but renamed for sanitization.
- **ChatGPT OAuth setup documentation**: new
  `documentation/chatgpt-oauth-setup.md` explains how to use a ChatGPT/Codex
  login token for OpenAI Realtime so eligible ChatGPT subscriptions can power
  calls instead of an OpenAI Platform API key. README, deployment,
  development, configuration, troubleshooting, `.env.example`, and docs index
  pages now link to the flow.
- **`voice.idle` safety nets** (issue #11): configurable guards stop the
  agent from running indefinitely on silent or off-topic callers.
  - **Silence hangup** (default ON, 15s away + 30s grace = 45s total
    silence). Wires `AgentSession.user_away_timeout` and a `user_state_changed`
    listener; if the caller stays `away` past the grace period, the agent
    says a brief "we'll wrap up" and disconnects with reason
    `silence_timeout`. Disable per business with `voice.idle.silence_hangup_enabled: false`.
  - **Max-duration cap** (default OFF). Set
    `voice.idle.max_call_duration_seconds: 900` to cap calls at 15 minutes;
    the agent will say goodbye and disconnect with reason
    `max_duration_reached` when the cap is reached.
  - **Absolute silence fallback** (default OFF). Set
    `voice.idle.absolute_silence_seconds: 120` to end with reason
    `silence_timeout` when no non-empty final user transcript arrives for two
    minutes, even if SIP comfort noise prevents LiveKit's `user_state` from
    becoming `away`.
  - **Unproductive-turn ceiling** (default ON, threshold 5). Counts
    consecutive agent replies that match a tunable list of "stuck"
    phrases (`unproductive_phrases`) AND did not invoke any function tool
    that turn. It only scores replies after a final caller transcript, so
    greetings and consent preambles cannot consume the budget. After the
    threshold, the agent ends with reason `unproductive_turns_exhausted`.
    Catches the Trinicom Blade Runner scenario where the caller monologues
    at the agent for 21 minutes.
- **`end_call` function tool** (issue #10): the agent can now end the call
  itself when the caller has clearly finished — e.g. "goodbye", "thanks,
  bye", "that's all I needed". The tool says a brief goodbye, then disconnects
  the SIP caller via `remove_participant` (preferred — sends a SIP BYE) and
  falls back to `delete_room` if removal fails. The system prompt teaches
  the LLM when to call it and, equally important, when NOT to call it.
- **`agent_ended` outcome and `agent_end_reason` field** on `CallMetadata`
  (issues #10/#11). Distinguishes agent-initiated hangups from caller
  hangups in call summaries, transcripts, and dashboards. The reason is a
  short label drawn from a closed vocabulary (`caller_goodbye`,
  `silence_timeout`, `unproductive_turns_exhausted`,
  `max_duration_reached`); call-end emails and Markdown transcript headers
  render it next to the outcome row.

### Fixed
- **Muted-call silence timeout fallback** (issue #11): SIP trunks that send
  comfort noise can keep LiveKit's `user_state` from becoming `away`, which
  bypassed the original silence watcher. The optional
  `voice.idle.absolute_silence_seconds` timer now measures wall-clock time
  since the last non-empty final user transcript and uses the same
  `silence_timeout` hangup path.
- **Benign post-close LiveKit engine warning** (issue #10): the exact
  `WARNING ... engine: connection error: engine is closed` line emitted after
  intentional call teardown is now suppressed while other engine connection
  errors still log normally.
- **CallerID resolution for non-SIP-kind participants** (issue #9):
  the SIP participant resolver no longer requires
  `participant.kind == PARTICIPANT_KIND_SIP`. Some BYOC/Asterisk SIP trunks
  publish the SIP participant with a different kind value but with an
  identity matching `sip_<digits>` and/or `sip.*` attributes. The kind gate
  was the silent-`Unknown` trap reported by @trinicomcom: even though the
  identity was clearly `sip_17135550038`, the helper short-circuited before
  the identity-regex fallback ran. The kind comparison is preserved as a
  preference in `_get_caller_identity` (SIP-kind participants still win) but
  is no longer a precondition.
- **Late SIP attribute updates** are now captured: `handle_call` subscribes
  to `participant_attributes_changed` and re-runs CallerID capture when any
  `sip.*` attribute arrives after the participant has already joined the
  room (Telnyx INVITE → PRACK delay, Asterisk diversion-header late update).

### Changed
- **LiveKit agent dispatch default** now registers the worker as
  `receptionist` via `RECEPTIONIST_AGENT_NAME`, matching production dispatch
  rules by default. Local Playground/wildcard testing can still set
  `RECEPTIONIST_AGENT_NAME=""` for the current process.
- **Always-on `agent.callerid` INFO logs** record the snapshot at
  `handle_call` start, the participant identity/kind/attribute keys for
  every capture attempt, and a clear positive/negative result line. Operators
  no longer need to flip a debug flag to diagnose CallerID issues.

### Added
- **Per-business OpenAI Realtime auth selection**: `voice.auth` can now
  choose how each business authenticates to the Realtime API. Omitting
  `voice.auth` preserves the existing `OPENAI_API_KEY` behavior; explicit
  options include `api_key` (custom env var), `oauth_codex` (Codex CLI /
  ChatGPT-login OAuth token at `~/.codex/auth.json`), and `oauth_static`
  (raw bearer token, inline or env-sourced). `oauth_codex` now refreshes
  expired access tokens with `tokens.refresh_token`, serializes concurrent
  refreshes with an in-process lock plus a per-file refresh lock, and writes
  rotated tokens back to the same auth file.
- **OpenAI OAuth setup CLI**: `python -m receptionist.voice setup <business>`
  validates an existing per-business target token when present; otherwise it
  runs Codex login, copies the Codex auth file to
  `secrets/<business>/openai_auth.json`, validates it, and updates the
  business YAML `voice.auth` block. `--reuse-existing-codex-auth` is available
  for non-interactive smoke tests that intentionally copy an existing Codex
  auth file.
- **Google Calendar integration** (issue #3): two new function tools
  (`check_availability`, `book_appointment`) let the agent book appointments
  on a per-business Google Calendar during live calls. Supports both
  service-account auth (Google Workspace) and OAuth 2.0 (any Google account)
  via a setup CLI. See `documentation/google-calendar-setup.md`.
- **`on_booking` email trigger**: fires a booking-specific email to staff
  when an appointment is booked. Reuses the existing EmailChannel dispatcher
  + retry infrastructure.
- **`receptionist/booking/` subpackage** with auth, client, availability
  (pure), booking (with race detection), and setup CLI modules.
- **`SlotProposal` + `BookingResult` dataclasses** for calendar types.
- **Setup CLI** at `python -m receptionist.booking setup <business-slug>`.
- **Optional caller-email calendar invite**: `book_appointment` accepts a
  `caller_email` parameter. When provided, the caller is added as an
  OPTIONAL Google attendee and Google sends them the standard
  invitation (with `.ics`, accept/decline, "Add to my calendar").
  Optional attendees do not impact the organizer's free/busy view if
  they decline.
- **`RECEPTIONIST_CONFIG` env var** lets `python -m receptionist.agent dev`
  pick a non-default business config without job metadata.
- **Relative-date resolver** in `check_availability`: "today",
  "tomorrow", "tonight", "next Monday", "this Friday" all resolve to
  absolute dates before parsing. Bare weekday names and absolute dates
  fall through unchanged.
- **Multi-channel message delivery**: `messages.channels` list supports `file`, `email`, and `webhook` types enabled simultaneously per business (design spec §2)
- **Call recording** via LiveKit Egress, stored locally or to S3/R2/B2/MinIO (spec §3)
- **Call transcripts** in JSON (source of truth) + Markdown, with per-call metadata (caller, outcome, duration, tools invoked, languages detected)
- **Email delivery** via pluggable senders — SMTP (`aiosmtplib`) or Resend (`httpx`), behind a shared `EmailSender` protocol
- **Email triggers** — `on_message` (fires when `take_message` succeeds) and `on_call_end` (fires on every call end), toggleable per business
- **Consent preamble** spoken before the greeting when recording is enabled (configurable text, default-on when recording is on)
- **Multi-language auto-detection** — per-business `languages.primary` + `languages.allowed` whitelist; `gpt-realtime-1.5` handles detection, polite redirect when caller speaks an unsupported language
- **Retention sweeper** — `python -m receptionist.retention sweep [--dry-run] [--business <name>]`; configurable TTL per artifact type (`recordings_days`, `transcripts_days`, `messages_days`; 0 = keep forever); skips `.failures/` directories
- **Failures CLI** — `python -m receptionist.messaging list-failures` surfaces records in each business's `.failures/` directory
- **Env-var interpolation** in YAML (`${VAR_NAME}` expanded against `os.environ` at load time; missing vars raise `ConfigError` at startup)
- **Configurable voice** — `voice.voice_id` default changed to `marin` (trained for `gpt-realtime-1.5`)
- New package structure: `receptionist/messaging/`, `receptionist/email/`, `receptionist/recording/`, `receptionist/transcript/`, `receptionist/retention/`, `receptionist/lifecycle.py`
- ~50 new unit tests across the new subpackages; 1 integration test (`tests/integration/test_call_flow.py`) for end-to-end message + call-end flows
- New gitignored artifact directories: `transcripts/`, `recordings/`
- `.python-version` pinned to `3.12`

### Changed
- **BREAKING: `CallMetadata.outcome: str | None` → `CallMetadata.outcomes: set[str]`**
  to support calls with multiple outcomes (e.g. transferred AND book an
  appointment). Email subjects and transcript headers render multi-outcome
  cases as "Transferred + Appointment booked". No external consumers of the
  old shape were known at the time of the change.
- **Valid outcomes** now include `"appointment_booked"` alongside
  `hung_up`, `message_taken`, `transferred`.
- New production deps: `google-api-python-client>=2.140`, `google-auth>=2.32`,
  `google-auth-oauthlib>=1.2`, `python-dateutil>=2.9` (all Apache 2.0).
- System prompt (`prompts.py`) gains a CALENDAR section when
  `config.calendar.enabled: true` — describes the two tools, the
  verbal-confirmation convention, and the no-fabrication hard rule.
- `Receptionist.__init__` gains a bounded `_offered_slot_batches:
  deque[frozenset[str]]` (maxlen=3) session cache, a cached
  `_dispatcher` for take_message, and a `_routing_by_name` dict for
  case-insensitive O(1) department lookup. `_calendar_client` is still
  lazily constructed on first calendar tool call.
- New artifact directory: `secrets/<business>/` (gitignored) for calendar
  credentials — service account JSON keys and OAuth token files.
- **Default voice model**: `gpt-realtime` → `gpt-realtime-1.5` (+7% instruction following, +10% alphanumeric transcription, +5% Big Bench Audio reasoning — same pricing)
- **`Receptionist`** now takes a `CallLifecycle` parameter; tool methods update per-call metadata (FAQs answered, transfer target, message-taken flag)
- **`take_message`** routes through the new `Dispatcher` — file channel completes synchronously (durable confirmation), email/webhook run as background tasks with retry/backoff
- **Legacy `messages.delivery: "file"` config form** is still accepted via a Pydantic `model_validator` that auto-converts it to the new `channels: [...]` list (deprecation warning logged)
- **`receptionist/messages.py`** removed; its contents moved to `receptionist/messaging/{models,channels/file}.py`
- **Dependency floor bumps**: `livekit-agents>=1.5.0`, `livekit-plugins-openai>=1.5.0`
- New production dependencies: `aiosmtplib>=3.0`, `resend>=2.0`, `httpx>=0.27`, `aioboto3>=13.0`, `aiofiles>=23.0`
- New dev dependencies: `pytest-mock>=3.12`, `respx>=0.21`, `moto>=5.0`
- **CALENDAR prompt block**: agent now reads back the callback number
  digit-by-digit and (when the caller volunteers an email) reads it
  back letter-by-letter, awaiting an explicit "yes" before booking.
  Prevents mishearings from being committed to a real calendar event.
- **`book_appointment` signature**: gains optional `caller_email: str | None`
  parameter (default `None` keeps the prior no-attendee behavior).

### Fixed
- **BYOC/Asterisk CallerID fallback** (issue #9, reported by @trinicomcom):
  if LiveKit does not populate `sip.phoneNumber`, CallerID resolution now
  falls back to `sip.fromUser`, `sip.from`, and SIP participant identities
  like `sip_17135550038`. The agent also re-scans existing room participants
  after registering the `participant_connected` handler to close the small
  connect-window race.
- **CallerID capture race** (issue #9, reported by @trinicomcom): call-end
  emails and transcripts could show `Caller: Unknown` because
  `sip.phoneNumber` was read before the SIP participant had joined the
  LiveKit room. The agent now also captures the caller phone when
  LiveKit emits `participant_connected` for the SIP participant.
- **Transfer target visibility** (issue #9, reported by @trinicomcom):
  call-end email subjects, HTML email bodies, and Markdown transcript
  headers now show the matched transfer destination (for example,
  `Transferred to Agent Smith`). The value was already stored in JSON
  transcript metadata and the plain-text email body, but the HTML email
  body omitted it, so most mail clients hid it.
- **Call-end HTML email parity**: appointment details, FAQs answered,
  languages detected, transcript path, and recording-failed status now
  render in the HTML body to match the plain-text call-end email body.
- **Friendlier YAML error for the "uncommented with leading space" trap**
  (issue #8, reported by @trinicomcom): leaving a single space before
  a top-level section (e.g. ` sip:` instead of `sip:`) used to produce
  the cryptic `expected <block end>, but found '<block mapping start>'`
  parser error pointing at the wrong line. `BusinessConfig.from_yaml_string`
  now wraps `yaml.YAMLError` in a new `ConfigError` and detects this
  exact pattern, producing a message that names the offending section
  and explains how to fix it. The original yaml error is still chained
  via `raise ... from e` for debugging. Example YAML config and the
  troubleshooting doc updated with explicit "remove BOTH the # AND the
  space" guidance above each commented section.
- **SIP transfer URI configurable** (issue #6, reported by @trinicomcom):
  the `transfer_call` tool used to hardcode `tel:{number}` for the
  LiveKit SIP transfer URI. That works for Twilio/Telnyx/most BYOC, but
  Asterisk classic `sip.conf` (chan_sip) rejects tel-URIs and the
  transfer would fail. Added a `sip.transfer_uri_template` field
  (default `"tel:{number}"`, validators require `{number}` placeholder)
  so Asterisk users can set `"sip:{number}"` or
  `"sip:{number}@your-pbx"`. Default behavior is unchanged for everyone
  on Twilio/Telnyx/BYOC.
- **OAuth scope**: added `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.freebusy`
  alongside `calendar.events`. The events scope alone is insufficient for
  `freeBusy.query` (Google treats freeBusy as a calendar-level operation,
  not an events-level one). Existing OAuth tokens issued for the
  single-scope set must be re-minted via `python -m receptionist.booking
  setup <business>`.
- **Setup CLI Unicode crash**: replaced `✓` markers with `[OK]`. Default
  Windows `cp1252` console can't render U+2713 — would crash AFTER a
  successful token write/chmod, masking the prior success.
- **Relative-date parsing**: `dateutil.parser` doesn't understand "today"
  / "tomorrow" / "next Monday" — `check_availability` would return
  "couldn't parse that date" for caller phrasings the prompt advertised
  as supported. Added `_resolve_relative_date()` that normalizes those
  phrases before parsing.
- **Setup CLI now validates `business_slug`** with the same
  `^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$` regex used elsewhere. `python -m receptionist.booking
  setup ../../etc/passwd` previously would have resolved into a path
  traversal attempt; now rejected by argparse with a clear error.
- **`take_message` and `book_appointment` cap caller-supplied free-text**
  fields (caller_name 200, callback_number 50, message 4000, notes
  1000, caller_email 254). Truncation logged at INFO; staff can pull
  the original from logs if needed. Prevents storage bloat and
  Google's 8KB calendar event description ceiling from being hit.
- **Webhook URL safety**: `WebhookChannel.url` now hard-rejects schemes
  other than `http`/`https` at config load (no more `file://`,
  `data:`, etc.) and warns when the host is loopback / private /
  link-local (legitimate in dev but a common SSRF foot-gun in prod —
  e.g. AWS metadata endpoint at `169.254.169.254`).
- **Production code asserts replaced with explicit raises**:
  `recording/storage.py`, `recording/egress.py`, `messaging/retry.py`
  used `assert x is not None` patterns that are stripped under
  `python -O`. Now raise `ValueError`/`RuntimeError` so optimized-mode
  failures are debuggable.
- **`CallMetadata.mark_finalized()`** now logs at WARNING when
  `start_ts`/`end_ts` parsing fails instead of silently leaving
  `duration_seconds` at `None`.
- **Windows OAuth token ACL**: `_check_token_permissions` previously
  returned silently on Windows. Now logs a one-shot WARNING per token
  path nudging operators to put the file in a user-only directory
  (stdlib has no NTFS-ACL inspection without `pywin32`, so a hard
  guard would require an extra dep).

### Performance
- **`Dispatcher` and `EmailChannel` instances cached per call** instead
  of reconstructed per `take_message` / per email trigger. Saves
  filesystem walk + dict iteration on every invocation.
- **`_offered_slots` is now bounded** — replaced unbounded `set[str]`
  with `deque[frozenset[str]]` of `maxlen=3`. Prevents the cache from
  growing without limit on long, chatty calls. Behavior unchanged at
  the LLM level (only the most recent batch ever matters in practice).
- **Routing lookup is now O(1)** via dict-by-lowercased-name built at
  `Receptionist.__init__`. FAQ matching deliberately stays linear (its
  bidirectional substring match doesn't fit a single dict).
- **Lightweight imports hoisted** out of `check_availability` and
  `book_appointment`. The `googleapiclient`-pulling chain stays
  deferred so calendar-disabled businesses still skip the ~50MB import
  cost.

### Security
- OAuth token files enforced to `0600` permissions on Unix at agent startup
  (no-op on Windows).
- Calendar events tagged `[via AI receptionist / UNVERIFIED]` permanently
  so staff see the caller's identity was not verified.
- `sendUpdates="none"` on `events.insert` when no caller email is
  provided — no side-channel notifications from Google. When the
  caller volunteers an email, `sendUpdates="all"` and the caller is
  added as an OPTIONAL attendee so they get the standard invite.
- Calendar credentials are per-business, isolated in `secrets/<business>/`.
- Env-var interpolation avoids storing secrets in YAML files
- Call ID is sanitized (`[^a-zA-Z0-9_-]` stripped) before use in artifact paths
- `.failures/` records retain delivery context (no credential leakage — sender auth details stay in logs only)
